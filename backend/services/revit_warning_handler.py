"""
Revit Warning Handler — deterministic pattern-based correction before the AI fallback.

The orchestrator calls handle_warnings() on every non-final correction attempt.
It matches warning strings against known Revit error patterns and applies surgical
recipe edits without an LLM call.  Any warnings it cannot handle are returned as
*unresolved* so SemanticAnalyzer can take a second pass.

Known patterns handled
──────────────────────
  "cannot keep elements joined"        → remove the framing element whose endpoint
                                         overlaps a column bounding box the most.
  "identical instances in the same"    → already deduped pre-export; log only.
  "ExternalEvent" / "Pending"          → Revit modal-dialog state; no recipe fix.
  "one or more unresolved references"  → family not loaded; remove that element type.
  "the column is too short"            → raise column height to MIN_COLUMN_HEIGHT_MM.
  "highlights elements whose"          → Revit join-highlight alias → same as join error.
